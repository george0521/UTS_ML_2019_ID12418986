        "Meme, proposed by British biologist Richard Dawkins in ‘The Selfish Genes’, refers to the (smallest) cultural unit duplicated by imitation. (Dawkins, 1976) Many people question that the study of memes is too metaphorical and that it is difficult to define the object of study accurately. Blackmore (1998) points out that imitation is different from \"infection\". Blackmore specifically emphasizes this point in order to distinguish between imitative and non-imitative learning. Memes must be disseminated through imitative learning. \n",

        "Dawkins pointed out that memes are like genes, and their transmission is similar to natural selection. Successful replication of memes has three characteristics: longevity, productivity and duplication faithfulness."

        "Information technology provides time and space convenience for information dissemination. Especially in the past decade, the rapid development of social networks has stimulated the surge of information and meme relies on these replication of information in the network.Usually people refer to the large-scale forwarding of some information in cyberspace, especially in social networks, as viral transmission. Predicting whether memes will become viruses and extending them to create \"memorable\" content is a complex issue.\n",

        "Because of the huge amount of content generated and disseminated through social media and the limited attention of users, it is difficult to get high traffic for content with small proportion. Moreover, because the subject can be changed at any time, memes have a high degree of dynamic behavior, which further increases the difficulty of prediction.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the same time, because of the instantaneity of information, those memes which reach the peak of traffic in a short time and decay rapidly make it more difficult to predict the future. The active period of this information can often last for several hours to even months. Similarly, the prediction of memes can not be based on historical data and trends as traditional prediction models do.Because memes have a high degree of dynamic behavior,It will change instantly as global relations change."

Such as some people may make use of the characteristics of rapid information dissemination to publicize the established facts by creating and distorting the second time, so as to achieve their own goals. Even by adding some radical remarks to shape public attitudes and influence the public. Institutions should protect more important information by learning about information that may be widely disseminated and spreading it virally. If developers continue to mine huge social media data to create predictive models, they must be alert to the unethical nature of their work and take a utilitarian stance to design solutions that help most people. And this is the main problem facing us at the present stage."
